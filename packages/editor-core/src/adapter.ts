/// EngineAdapter — the backend seam (SDK-LAYERS L1↔L2). It abstracts the ACTUAL surface a backend
/// exposes (open / page SVG / hit-test·tableAt / applyIntent / undo·redo / export) so the SAME
/// editor-core (and any UI over it) runs against two backends: `WasmAdapter` (wraps @tf-hwp/engine, in
/// @tf-hwp/react) and a host `TauriAdapter` (reference impl). Every method is async so a Promise-based
/// Tauri `invoke` backend and the synchronous wasm backend both satisfy one interface.
///
/// This interface DESCENDED from @tf-hwp/react (issue 026) so editor-core depends only on the adapter,
/// not on React. @tf-hwp/react re-exports the type (hosts keep importing it from there).
///
/// R7 boundary: `pageSvg` returns a document-derived string that the ADAPTER may or may not have
/// sanitized. It is UNTRUSTED regardless — the UI layer ALWAYS routes it through `sanitizeSvg` before
/// injection. There is deliberately no method that injects an SVG string bypassing that gate.
///
/// Coordinate contract: `hitTest`/`tableAt`/`tableCellAt`/`blocksInRect` take PAGE-LOCAL px (own-render
/// px = HWPUNIT/75) and return boxes in the same space; the UI does the client-px ↔ page-px conversion.
